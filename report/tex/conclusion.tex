In this project artificial neural networks were used to identify Higgs boson decay events in the $b\bar{b}b$ channel for the purpose of identifying the excess of $\phi \rightarrow b\bar{b} $ decays predicted by minimal supersymmetric standard model compared to the standard model. A set of features describing the collision events measured at the D$\emptyset$ were identified and used to train ANNs with a variety of topologies, with the goal of identifying an optimal configuration by cross validation. However this proved difficult due to the time required to train the networks and the apparent lack of a trend in the summary statistics (AUC and $\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}$) we used to compare networks. A potential alternative approach would to start with large network and use a regularising Bayesian prior on the weights \cite{murphy2012machine}, or a separate algorithm such as Optimal Brain Surgery\cite{hassibi1993optimal} to shrink the network to an optimal size.
