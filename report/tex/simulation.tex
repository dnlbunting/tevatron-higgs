The Monte Carlo simulation of the events used in the training and evaluation of the neural networks is beyond the scope of this project, so will only be briefly summarised here. Signal $\phi b \rightarrow b\bar{b}b $ events were simulated using the PYTHIA \cite{sjostrand2006pythia} to leading order with a mass hypothesis  of $M_H = 110 \mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ and then corrected to next-to-leading order with MCFM \cite{campbell2010mcfm}. The background multijet events were generated using ALPGEN \cite{mangano2003alpgen}. The simulated events were then passed through a model of the D$\emptyset$ detector \cite{brun1993geant}. Finally various preprocessing cuts were applied to the data excluding unlikely signal events.
